  <b>1. User-centric booking process</b>  <br>
The customer is the king of any sort of business. Be it online or offline. Your app should be optimized in a way so that the user will face no inconvenience when booking a ride. It should feel smooth and navigation should be easy and user-friendly.  <br> <br>

<b>2. Real-time ride tracking</b> <br>
Users should be provided with the facility to track their taxi once they order it. They must not have any doubt about when will the taxi arrive or where the taxi is right now. Right until they get off at their destination, they should be able to track their taxi’s location. <br><br>

<b>3. Booking flexibility</b> <br>
The user should be allowed to book a taxi right away or sometime later. Canceling ordered services should also be allowed. These tasks should be hassle-free. <br> <br>

<b>4. Transparent booking process</b> <br>
All the information about the fare should be available for the user. Your service should be trustworthy and a transparent booking process is a key feature your app should have.
<br> <br>
<b>5. Taxi details</b> <br> 
Taxi details like the driver’s details and the vehicle’s details must be available. The user should be allowed to view them for security and safety purposes. <br> <br>

<b>6. Ride feedback</b> <br>
This is one of the most important aspects your service should have. Users should be allowed to give feedback on his/her experience, even if they need to post a bad review. This option means that your service does not hide the reality which makes it more trustworthy. Then it is up to you to make the necessary adjustments in your service based on them.
<br> <br>
<b>7. Travel history</b> <br>
Records of travel details should be made available to the user. The user should feel that your app is the go-to choice when ordering a taxi. Without this option, your app would be just another app on their smartphones. <br> <br>

<b>8. Emergency Contact</b> <br>
Emergency contact is crucial to ensure the safety of the user. This feature must not be missing in your cab solution. Thankfully, most cab ordering apps have this feature. <br> <br>

<b>9. Location-saving features</b> <br> 
Saving the location of the user makes it easier for them to book a ride. They will just have the select one of their favorite locations and order a taxi. This attractive feature will draw more customers your way. <br> <br>

<b>10. Report analysis services for back-end use</b> <br> 
Data collected through the system is so valuable. You can take a deep insight into customer behavior and take wise decisions on how to improve and what changes should be made. <br> <br>
